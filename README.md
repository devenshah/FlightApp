There is no need for any grumpy grunting or to wait for a bower to build a nest. Just download the files and start a http-server in the root folder, navigate to the localhost:port and hopefully it will show you the light. 

Please feel free to comment here directly so I get first hand feedback.

Thanks for your time.
